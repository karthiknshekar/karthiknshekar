<h1>HISTORY OF FENCING</h1>
<br>
<img src="hf1.jpg " height="240px" width="300px" align="left">
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <p>Fencing traces its roots to the development of swordsmanship for duels and self 
defense. Fencing is believed to have originated in Spain; some of the most significant
 books on fencing were written by Spanish fencers. Treatise on Arms was written by
 Diego de Valera between 1458 and 1471 and is one of the oldest surviving manuals on
 western fencing (in spite of the title, the book of Diego Valera was on heraldry, not
 about fencing) shortly before dueling came under official ban by the Catholic
 Monarchs. In conquest, the Spanish forces carried fencing around the world, 
 particularly to southern Italy, one of the major areas of strife between both
 nations. Fencing was mentioned in the play The Merry Wives of Windsor written
 sometime prior to 1602.

The mechanics of modern fencing originated in the 18th century in an Italian school 
of fencing of the Renaissance, and under their influence, were improved by the French 
school of fencing. The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced by 
the Italian and French schools.
Development into a sport

The shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from
 the mid-18th century, and was led by Domenico Angelo, who established a fencing
 academy, Angelo's School of Arms, in Carlisle House, Soho, London in 1763.
 There, he taught the aristocracy the fashionable art of swordsmanship. His school
 was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing
 for almost a century. </p></center>
