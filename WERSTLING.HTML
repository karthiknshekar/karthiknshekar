<P>Professional wrestling, often shortened to pro wrestling or simply wrestling,
 is a form of performance art and entertainment that 
 combines athletics with theatrical performance. It takes the form of 
 events, held by touring companies, that mimic a title-match combat sport.
 The unique form of sport portrayed is fundamentally based on and evolved
 from classical and "catch" wrestling, with modern additions of striking
 attacks, strength-based holds and throws and acrobatic maneuvers. Much of
 these derive from the influence of various international martial arts. 
 An additional aspect of combat with improvised weaponry is sometimes included
 .

The matches have predetermined outcomes to heighten entertainment value
 and all combative maneuvers are executed with the full cooperation of those 
 involved and carefully performed in specific manners intended to lessen the
 "chance" of actual injury. These facts were once kept highly secret but
 are now publicly acknowledged by both performers and promotions. To promote
 and sustain the willing suspension of disbelief by maintaining an aura of
 verisimilitude, the performing company avoids discussing the true nature 
 of the performance in official media. Fan communications by individual wrestlers
 and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) often directly 
 "acknowledge" the dramatic and "fixed" nature of the spectacle.
 
</P>
<P>Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe and later as a sideshow exhibition
 in North American traveling carnivals and vaudeville halls, professional wrestling grew into a standalone 
 genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe, and is now a billion dollar 
 entertainment industry. Since the 1980s, local forms have greatly declined in Europe, wrestling from North
 America has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and 
 a half of existence and has been exported back to Europe to fill the cultural gap left by the aforementioned 
 decline of local versions. The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet, and wrestling 
 (along with boxing) was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery. In light of
 the growth of online video-on-demand, native professional wrestling promotions in markets all over the world 
 have been able to circumvent traditional content delivery, and reach customers directly via social media and
 word of mouth.
