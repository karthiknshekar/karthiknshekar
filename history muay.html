<h1>HISTORY OF MUAY THAI</h1>
<br>
<img src="m1.jpg " height="240px" width="300px" align="left">
<p>The history of Muay Thai can also be traced to the middle of the 18th century.
 During the battles between the Burmese of the Konbaung Dynasty and Ayutthaya
 Kingdom Burmese-Siamese War (1765-1767) Muay boran, and therefore Muay Thai,
 was originally called by more generic names such as Toi muay or simply muay.
 As well as being a practical fighting technique for use in actual warfare, muay
 became a sport in which the opponents fought in front of spectators who went to
 watch for entertainment. These muay contests gradually became an integral part
 of local festivals and celebrations, especially those held at temples. Eventually,
 e previously bare-fisted fighters started wearing lengths of hemp rope around 
 their hands and forearms. This type of match was called muay khat chueak .
 Kickboxing was also a component of military training and gained 
 prominence during the reign of King Naresuan the Great in 1560 CE.

Muay Thai is referred to as the "Art of Eight Limbs" or the "Science of Eight
 Limbs", because it makes use of punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes, thus 
 using eight "points of contact", as opposed to "two points" (fists) in boxing
 and "four points" (hands and feet) used in other more regulated combat sports,
 such as kickboxing and savate. A practitioner of Muay Thai is known as a 
 nak muay. Western practitioners are sometimes called Nak Muay Farang, meaning
 "foreign boxer". </p>

The ascension of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) to the throne in 1868 ushered in a golden age not only for muay but for the whole country of Thailand. Muay progressed greatly during the reign of Rama V as a direct result of the king's personal interest in the sport. The country was at peace and muay functioned as a means of physical exercise, self-defense, attacking, recreation, and personal advancement.[citation needed]
