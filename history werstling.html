<h1>HISTORY OF WERSTLING</h1>
<br>
<img src="hw2.jpg " height="240px" width="300px" align="left">
<p>Wrestling represents one of the oldest forms of combat. The origins of wrestling go
 back 15,000 years through cave drawings. Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show
 wrestlers using most of the holds known in the present-day sport. Literary references
 to it occur as early as the Old Testament and the ancient Indian Vedas.
 In the Book of Genesis, the Patriarch Jacob is said to have wrestled with
 God or an angel. The Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of
 the 13th or 12th century BC, also contains mentions of wrestling. Indian
 epics Ramayana and Mahabharata contain references to martial arts including
 wrestling. In ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend
 and literature; wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the
 focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games. The ancient Romans borrowed heavily
 from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality.

During the Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century) wrestling remained
 popular and enjoyed the patronage of many royal families, including those of France,
 Japan and England.

Early British settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them. 
The settlers also found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans.
 Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the early years of the North American
 colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations,
 and in military exercises. The first organized national wrestling tournament took
 place in New York City in 1888. Wrestling has also been an event at every modern
 Olympic Games since the 1904 games in St. Louis, Missouri 
 (a demonstration had been performed at the first modern Olympics).
 The international governing body for the sport, United World Wrestling 
 (UWW), was established in 1912 in Antwerp, Belgium as the International
 Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA). The 1st NCAA Wrestling 
 Championships were also held in 1912, in Ames, Iowa. USA Wrestling, located in
 Colorado Springs, Colorado, became the national governing body of U.S.
 amateur wrestling in 1983.

 <h3>BY COUNTRY</h3>
 <ul>
<li>Michiel Sweerts, Wrestling Match, 1649

   <li> In Pharaonic Egypt, wrestling has been evidenced by documentation on tombs
   (circa 2300 BC) and Egyptian artwork (2000-1085 BC).</li>
   <li> Greek wrestling was a popular form of martial art, at least in Ancient
   Greece (about 1100 to 146 BC).</li>
    <li>Oil wrestling is the national sport of Turkey and it can be traced back
	to Central Asia.</li>
    <li>After the Roman conquest of the Greeks, Greek wrestling was absorbed by 
	the Roman culture and became Roman wrestling during the period of the Roman 
	Empire (510 BC to AD 500).</li>
    
    <li>Arabic literature depicted Muhammad as a skilled wrestler, defeating a 
	skeptic in a match at one point.</li>
   

    
    
    <li>The Lancashire style of folk wrestling may have formed the basis for Catch
	wrestling, also known as "catch as catch can." The Scots later formed a variant
	of this style, and the Irish developed the "collar-and-elbow" style which later
	found its way into the United States.</li>
