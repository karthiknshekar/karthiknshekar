<h1>HISTORY OF TAEKWONDO</h1>
<br>
<img src="ht2.jpg " height="240px" width="300px" align="left">
<p>Beginning in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II and Japanese
 Occupation, new martial arts schools called kwans opened in Seoul. These
 schools were established by Korean martial artists with backgrounds in
 (mostly) Japanese and Chinese martial arts. At the time, indigenous 
 disciplines (such as Taekkyeon) were all but forgotten, due to years of
 decline and repression by the Japanese colonial government. The umbrella
 term traditional Taekwondo typically refers to the martial arts practiced by 
 the kwans during the 1940s and 1950s, though in reality the term "Taekwondo"
 had not yet been coined at that time, and indeed each kwan  was 
 practicing its own unique fighting style.

In 1952, South Korean President Syngman Rhee witnessed a martial arts 
demonstration by ROK Officer Choi Hong-hi and Nam Tae-hi from the 29th 
Infantry Division. He misrecognized the technique on display as Taekkyeon,
 and urged martial arts to be introduced to the army under a single system. 
 Beginning in 1955 the leaders of the kwans began discussing in earnest the 
 possibility of creating a unified Korean martial art. Until then, Tang Soo 
 Do was used to name Korean Karate, using the Korean hanja pronunciation of the 
 Japanese kanji . The name Tae Soo Do  was also used to describe
 a unified style Korean martial arts. This name consists of the
 hanja tae "to stomp, trample",  su "hand" and do "way, discipline".
<br>
Choi Hong Hi advocated the use of the name Tae Kwon Do, i.e. replacing su "hand"
 by kwon "fist", the
 term also used for "martial arts" in Chinese . The name was
 also the closest to the pronunciation of Taekkyeon, in accordance with the
 views of the president. The new name was initially slow to catch on 
 among the leaders of the kwans. During this time Taekwondo was also adopted for
 use by the South Korean military, which increased its popularity among civilian 
 martial arts schools. </p></center>
