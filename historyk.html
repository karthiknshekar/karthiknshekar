<h1>HISTORY OF KALARIPIYATU </h1>

<img src="hk2.jpg " height="260px" width="300px" align="right"><br>
<p>The primary source of Indian martial arts is in Sangam literature. The Akananuru 
and Purananuru describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and silambam in the 
Sangam era. The word kalari appears in the Puram  and Akam 
 to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word kalari
 tatt denoted a martial feat, while kalari kozhai meant a coward in war. Each warrior
 in the Sangam era received regular military training in target practice, horse and
 elephant riding. In that period and during later periods, the word used for military 
 and military service was chevam. The warriors or soldiers in military service were was
 called Chekavar. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the
 period including the spear (vel), sword (val), shield (kedaham), and bow and arrow
 (vil ambu). The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors
 to Kalaripayattu. References to "Silappadikkaram" in Sangam literature
 date back to the 2nd century. This referred to the silambam staff which was in great 
 demand with foreign visitors.

Elements from the yoga tradition as well as finger movements in the nata dances, were
 incorporated into the fighting arts. A number of South Asian fighting styles
 remain closely connected to yoga, dance and performing arts. Some of the choreographed
 sparring in Kalaripayattu can be applied to dance and Kathakali 
 dancers who knew Kalaripayattu were believed to be markedly better than other
 performers. Until recently, the Chhau dance was performed only by martial artists. 
 Some traditional Indian classical dance schools still incorporate martial arts
 as part of their exercise regimen.

Kalaripayattu includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, weaponry and healing
 methods.Regional variants are classified according to geographical location
 in Kerala; these are the Northern style from the Malabar region in northern Kerala,
 and the Southern style from southern Kerala. Northern Kalaripayattu, or
 "Vadakkan Kalari" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions,
 jumps and weapons training, while the southern "Thekkan Kalari" style
 specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat
 and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts.
 Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor,
 as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor
 . Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also 
 utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali. </p>
