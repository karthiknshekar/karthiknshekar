<P>Shaolin Kung Fu , also called Shaolin
 Wushu  or Shaolin quan , is one of
 the oldest, largest, and most famous styles of wushu or kungfu. It combines
 Ch'an philosophy and martial arts and originated and was developed in the
 Shaolin temple in Henan province, China during its 1500-year history. Popular 
 sayings in Chinese folklore related to this practice include "All martial arts
 under heaven originated from Shaolin" and "Shaolin kung fu is the best under
 heaven," indicating the influence of Shaolin kung fu among martial arts. The 
 name Shaolin is also used as a brand for the so-called external styles of kung 
 fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin. </P>

Like the usual system of Chinese martial arts, Shaolin combat methods are taught via forms . Forms that are 
technically closely related are coupled together and are considered of the same sub-style. These are usually
 called the small and the big forms, like the small and big hong quan, which altogether make the Shaolin hong 
 quan style, and the small and big pao quan, etc. There are also some styles with one form, like taizu chang
 quan. Indeed, these styles are not complete or stand-alone, this is just a classification of different forms 
 of Shaolin kung fu based on their technical contents.

Shaolin kung fu has more than hundreds of extant styles. There is recorded documentation of more than a 
thousand extant forms, which makes Shaolin the biggest school of martial art in the world. In the Qing
 dynasty (1644-1911), Shaolin monks chose 100 of the best styles of Shaolin kung fu. Then they shortlisted
 the 18 most famous of them. However, every lineage of Shaolin monks have always chosen their own styles.
 Every style teaches unique methods for fighting  and keeping health via one or a few forms.
 To learn a complete system, Shaolin monks master a number of styles and weapons. The most famous 
 styles of Shaolin kung fu are</p>
