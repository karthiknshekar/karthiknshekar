In Ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed 
combat sport that combined Chinese martial arts, boxing and wrestling.

The Pancrastinae: A statue portraying the pancratium, an event which took place in
 the Roman Colosseum. Even as late as the Early Middle Ages, statues were put up in 
 Rome and other cities to honor remarkable pankratiasts. This statue, now part of
 the Uffizi collection, is a Roman copy of a lost Greek original, circa 3rd century 
 BC.

amphora, Lamberg Collection.

In Ancient Greece, there was a sport called pankration, which possibly mixed boxing
 and wrestling (both of Mesopotamian and Egyptian origin). All strikes and
 holds were allowed with the exception of biting and gouging, which were banned.
 The fighters, called pankratiasts, fought until someone could not continue or
 signaled submission by raising their index finger; there were no rounds.
 According to E. Norman Gardiner, "No branch of athletics was more popular than the
 pankration." There is evidence of similar mixed combat sports in Ancient Egypt,
 India and Japan.

The mid-19th century saw the prominence of the new sport savate in the combat 
sports circle. French savate fighters wanted to test their techniques against
 the traditional combat styles of its time. In 1852, a contest was held in France
 between French savateurs and English bare-knuckle boxers in which French fighter
 Rambaud alias la Resistance fought English fighter Dickinson and won using his kicks.
 However, the English team still won the four other match-ups during the contest.
 Contests occurred in the late 19th to mid-20th century between French Savateurs and
 other combat styles. Examples include a 1905 fight between French savateur George
 Dubois and a judo practitioner Re-nierand which resulted in the latter winning by
 submission, as well as the highly publicized 1957 fight between French savateur and
 professional boxer Jacques Cayron and a young Japanese karateka named Mochizuki Hiroo
 which ended when Cayron knocked Hiroo out with a hook.</P>
