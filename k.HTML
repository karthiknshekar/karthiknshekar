<P>Kalaripayattu  is an Indian martial art and
 fighting style that originated in modern-day Kerala. Kalaripayattu is also
 mentioned in the Vadakkan Pattukal ballads written about the Chekavar from
 the Malabar region of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is held in high regard due by 
 martial artists due to its long-standing history within Indian martial arts.
 It is believed to be the oldest surviving martial art in India. It also is 
 considered to be among the oldest martial arts still in existence, with its 
 origin in the martial arts timeline dating back to at least the 3rd century
 BCE. The author Arnaud Van Der Veere confers the origin of martial arts 
 to India , to which 
 he refers Kalaripayattu as "the mother of all martial arts." Kalaripayattu 
 is a martial art designed for the ancient battlefield  with weapons and combative techniques that are
 unique to India. Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge
 of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate
 the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as
 a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward
 the master, fellow-students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis 
 is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art
 only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available.

Unlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes.
 Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and
 still do so to this day. Keralite women such as Unniyarcha are mentioned
 in a collection of ballads from Kerala called Vadakkan Pattukal, and are
 praised for their martial prowess. In contemporary times, Sri Meenakshi
 Amma, a 73 year old gurukkal from Vadakara, was awarded the Padma Sri by
 the Government of India for her contributions to the preservation of 
 Kalaripayattu.

<P>The primary source of Indian martial arts is in Sangam literature.
 The Akananuru and Purananuru describe the use of spears, swords, shields,
 bows and silambam in the Sangam era. The word kalari appears in the Puram
  and Akam  to describe both
 a battlefield and combat arena. The word kalari tatt denoted a martial feat,
 while kalari kozhai meant a coward in war. Each warrior in the Sangam era
 received regular military training in target practice, horse and elephant
 riding. In that period and during later periods, the word used for military 
 and military service was chevam. The warriors or soldiers in military service
 were was called Chekavar. They specialized in one or more of the important 
 weapons of the period including the spear , sword , shield 
 , and bow and arrow . The combat techniques of the Sangam period 
 were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu.
