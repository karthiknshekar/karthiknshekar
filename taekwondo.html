<P>aekwondo is a combative sport and was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by Korean martial artists with
 experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions 
 such as Taekkyon, Subak, and Gwonbeop.The oldest governing body for Taekwondo is the Korea
 Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from
 the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools, in Korea. The main international organisational 
 bodies for Taekwondo today are the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), founded by Choi Hong
 Hi in 1966, and the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly WTF), founded in
 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo Association. Gyeorugi , a type of full-contact 
 sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000. The governing body for Taekwondo in the Olympics 
 and Paralympics is World Taekwondo.

<P>Beginning in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II and Japanese Occupation, new martial 
arts schools called kwans opened in Seoul. These schools were established by Korean martial artists
 with backgrounds in (mostly) Japanese[8] and Chinese martial arts. At the time, indigenous disciplines
 (such as Taekkyeon) were all but forgotten, due to years of decline and repression by the
 colonial government. The umbrella term traditional Taekwondo typically refers to the martial
 arts practiced by the kwans during the 1940s and 1950s, though in reality the term "Taekwondo" 
 had not yet been coined at that time, and indeed each kwan was practicing its own unique fighting style. </P>
