<p>Mixed martial arts , also known as cage fighting, is a full-contact
 combat sport that allows striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground,
 using techniques from various combat sports and martial arts. The first 
 documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by 
 television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993. The term gained popularity 
 when newfullcontact.com, then one of the largest websites covering the sport,
 hosted and republished the article. 

During the early 20th century, various interstylistic contests took place
 throughout Japan and in the countries of the Four Asian Tigers. In Brazil,
 there was the sport of Vale Tudo, in which fighters from various styles
 fought with little to no rules. The Gracie family was known to promote
 Vale Tudo matches as a way to promote their own Brazilian jiu-jitsu style.
  An early high-profile mixed martial arts bout was fought in 1951,
 between the judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu founder Helio
 Gracie in Brazil. In the West, the concept of combining elements of multiple
 martial arts was popularized by Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do during the late 1960s
 to early 1970s. A precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio
 Inoki bout, fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in 
 Japan, where it later inspired the foundation of Pancrase in 1993 and Pride
 Fighting Championships in 1997. </p>

The movement that led to the creation of present day mixed martial arts scenes
 was rooted in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The vale tudo events in Brazil.

Vale tudo began in the 1920s and became gained renown through its association
 with the "Gracie challenge", which was issued by Carlos Gracie and Helio
 Gracie and upheld later by descendants of the Gracie family. The "Gracie Challenges"
 were held in the garages and gyms of the Gracie family members. When the 
 popularity grew, these types of mixed bouts were a staple attraction at the
 carnivals in Brazil. Early mixed-match martial arts professional wrestling
 bouts in Japan became popular with Antonio Inoki 
 
only in the 1970s. Inoki was a disciple of Rikid≈çzan, but also of Karl
 Gotch, who trained numerous Japanese wrestlers in catch wrestling.

Regulated mixed martial arts competitions were first introduced in the
 United States by CV Productions, Its first competition, called
 Tough Guy Contest was held on March 20, 1980, New Kensington, Pennsylvania,
 Holiday Inn. During that year the company renamed the brand to Super Fighters 
 and sanctioned ten regulated tournaments in Pennsylvania.   </P>
