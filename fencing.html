<P>Fencing is a group of three related combat sports. The three disciplines in
 modern fencing are the foil, the epee, and the sabre  winning 
 points are made through the weapon's contact with an opponent. A fourth 
 discipline, singlestick, appeared in the 1904 Olympics but was dropped 
 after that, and is not a part of modern fencing. Fencing was one of the 
 first sports to be played in the Olympics. Based on the traditional skills
 of swordsmanship, the modern sport arose at the end of the 19th century,
 with the Italian school having modified the historical European martial 
 art of classical fencing, and the French school later refining the Italian
 system. There are three forms of modern fencing, each of which uses a
 different kind of weapon and has different rules; thus the sport itself 
 is divided into three competitive scenes: foil, epee, and sabre. Most
 competitive fencers choose to specialize in one weapon only. 
</P>
<P>Fencing traces its roots to the development of swordsmanship for duels and self defense. Fencing is believed
 to have originated in Spain; some of the 
most significant books on fencing were written by Spanish fencers. Treatise on Arms was written by Diego de
 Valera between 1458 and 1471 and is one of
 the oldest surviving manuals on western fencing (in spite of the title, the book of Diego Valera was on heraldry,
 
 not about fencing) shortly before
 dueling came under official ban by the Catholic Monarchs. In conquest, the Spanish forces carried fencing 
 around the world, particularly to southern 
 Italy, one of the major areas of strife between both nations.Fencing was mentioned in the play The
 Merry Wives of Windsor written sometime prior
 to 1602.

The mechanics of modern fencing originated in the 18th century in an Italian school of fencing of the Renaissance,
 and under their influence, were 
improved by the French school of fencing. The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced
 by the Italian and French schools.
