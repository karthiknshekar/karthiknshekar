<h1>HISTORY OF SHOLIN</h1>
<p><h2>Chinese martial arts before Shaolin</h2>
<img src="hs1.jpg " height="240px" width="300px" align="left">
Chinese historical records, like Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue, the 
Bibliographies in the Book of the Han Dynasty, the Records of the Grand Historian,
 and other sources document the existence of martial arts in China for thousands
 of years. For example, the Chinese martial art of wrestling, Shuai Jiao, predates 
 the establishment of Shaolin temple by several centuries. Since Chinese
 monasteries were large landed estates, sources of considerable regular
 income, monks required protection. Historical discoveries indicate that,
 even before the establishment of Shaolin temple, monks had arms and also 
 practiced martial arts. In 1784 the Boxing Classic: Essential Boxing Methods
 made the earliest extant reference to the Shaolin Monastery as Chinese boxing's
 place of origin. This is, however, a misconception,but shows 
 the historical importance of Shaolin kung fu.
Southern and Northern dynasties (420-589 AD)
Shaolin temple established

Bodhidharma is a youngest son of the Pallava prince Vishnagopa. He excelled in 
Sword fighting and Archery. In order to fulfill his destiny he traveled across
 North East Asia (current China and Japan). During his journey across North India
 he preached Buddhism and became a Buddhist monk . He is traditionally credited as 
 the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch.
 According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the monks of 
 Shaolin Monastery that led to the creation of Shaolin kungfu. In Japan, he is known
 as Daruma.<br>
 <br>

In 495 AD, Shaolin temple was built among the Song mountains in Henan province.
 The first monk who preached Buddhism there was the Indian monk named Buddhabhadra 
  simply called Batuo  by the Chinese. There are
 historical records that Batuo's first Chinese disciples, Huiguang  and 
 Sengchou , both had exceptional martial skills. For example, Sengchou's 
 skill with the tin staff is even documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon. 
 After Buddhabadra, the monk Bodhidharma, described as either 
 Central Asian or Indian and simply called Damo  by the Chinese, came to
 Shaolin in 527 AD. His Chinese disciple, Huike , was also a highly 
 trained martial arts expert. There are hints that these first three Chinese
 Shaolin monks, Huiguang, Sengchou, and Huike, may have been military men 
 before entering the monastic life.
Bodhidharma's influence

Some popular historians consider Bodhidharma, the first patriarch of 
Chinese Buddhism, as the founder of Shaolin kung fu.

The idea of Bodhidharma influencing Shaolin boxing is based on a qigong manual
 written during the 17th century. This is when a Taoist with the pen name
 'Purple Coagulation Man of the Way' wrote the Sinews Changing Classic in 
 1624, but claimed to have discovered it. The first of two prefaces of the
 manual traces this succession from Bodhidharma to the Chinese general Li 
 Jing via "a chain of Buddhist saints and martial heroes."(p165) The work
 itself is full of anachronistic mistakes and even includes a popular character 
 from Chinese fiction, the 'Qiuran Ke' ('Bushy Bearded Hero') , as a
 lineage master. Literati as far back as the Qing Dynasty have taken note
 of these mistakes. The scholar Ling Tinkang (1757-1809) described the author 
 as an "ignorant village master" .</p>
